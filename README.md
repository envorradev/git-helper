# Git Helper

Simple helper to write multi git command routines. 

## Disclaimer

A lot is still under development and may not be completed. We use this for routines in our dev environment, so really only adding features as needed.

Things will likely break between versions, don't use this in production.

## Install

```php
$ composer require --dev envorradev/git-helper
```
